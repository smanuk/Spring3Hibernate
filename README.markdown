Spring3Hibernate4
=================

The application implements a very basic contact manager.

This is my first attempt at Spring 3 with Tiles support.  It uses Hibernate 4 to connect to a remote MySQL database.

As this was more an environmental set up exercise there is a distinct lack of any testing classes, however this will be my
next order of business after I get the Git/GitHub integration sorted out.

This project was coded and tested in Spring Tool Suite (STS) 3.1.0 with JDK 1.6.0_37.

Currently I run this application on a local version of Tomcat 7.
